    **`Optimization using SciPy linprog`**
    
    A farmer has recently acquired a 110 hectares piece of land. He hasdecided to grow Wheat and barley on that land. Due to the qualityof the sun and the region's excellent climate, the entire production ofWheat and Barley can be sold. He wants to know how to plant eachvariety in the 110 hectares, given the costs, net profits and laborrequirements according to the data shown below:

    <table class="tg">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="tg-0pky">Crop</th>
        <th class="tg-0pky">Cost / Hect</th>
        <th class="tg-0pky">Profit (per Hect.)</th>
        <th class="tg-0pky">Man Days / Hect.</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="tg-0pky">Wheat</td>
        <td class="tg-0pky">7000/-</td>
        <td class="tg-0pky">50/-</td>
        <td class="tg-0pky">10 Days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tg-0pky">Barley</td>
        <td class="tg-0pky">2000/-</td>
        <td class="tg-0pky">120/-</td>
        <td class="tg-0pky">30 Days</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    The farmer has a budget of Rs. 7,00,000 and availability of 1,200man-days during the planning horizon. Find the optimal solution andthe optimal value.
